# morpho-benchmarks

This folder includes a variety of programs to assist in benchmarking [morpho](https://github.com/Morpho-lang/morpho)'s performance. The tests are divided into several folders: 

* clbg - Benchmarks from the [Computer Language Benchmark Game](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/index.html), intended to compare morpho to other languages on similar test problems.

* language - Benchmarks for language features.

* other - Interesting problems, some of which are provided in multiple languages.

* problems - Shape optimization problems that aim to represent typical morpho use cases.

For each of these a simple benchmarking script is provided.
